challenge
=========
GUIDELINES:

    Look at main(): it calls various functions.
    You are asked to implement two functions: str_cpy() and str_cat(). No need to implement str_printf() and str_free()
    The code you write needs to be "library quality"; as good as you would expect a good libc to implement such functions.
    At the top of the page, you see 4 includes - indicating the functions that can be used to implement str_cpy() and str_cat().
