GUIDELINES:

    Look at main(): it calls various functions.
    You are asked to implement two functions: str_cpy() and str_cat(). No need to implement str_printf() and str_free() (Jungo employees: you are required to implement them).
    Reading main() carefully will allow to understand str_cpy() and str_cat() signature and usage.
    The code you write needs to be "library quality"; as good as you would expect a good libc to implement such functions.
    At the top of the page, you see 4 includes - indicating the functions that can be used to implement str_cpy() and str_cat().
    FYI: It is possible to implement str_cpy() and str_cat() efficiently in no more than 7 lines of code per function, and in less than 5 minutes.
